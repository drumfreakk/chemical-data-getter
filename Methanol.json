Its [[energy density]] is, however, lower than [[methane]], per kg. Its combustion energy density is 15.6 [[joule|MJ]]/[[liter|L]] ([[Heat of combustion#Lower heating value|LHV]]), whereas that of ethanol is 24 and gasoline is 33 MJ/L.\n\nFurther advantages for methanol is its ready biodegradability and low environmental toxicity. It does not persist in either aerobic (oxygen-present) or anaerobic (oxygen-absent) environments. The half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days, while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days (such as [[benzene]] at 10\u2013730 days). Since methanol is [[miscibility|miscible]] with water and biodegradable, it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater, surface water, air or soil.<ref>[http://www.methanol.org/Environment/Resources/Environment/MP-Methanol-Fate.aspx Evaluation of the Fate and Transport of Methanol in the Environment] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516022250/http://www.methanol.org/Environment/Resources/Environment/MP-Methanol-Fate.aspx |date=16 May 2016 }}, Malcolm Pirnie, Inc., January 1999.</ref>\n\n====Fuel====\n{{Main|Methanol fuel|methanol economy}}\nMethanol is occasionally used to fuel [[internal combustion engine]]s.

According to Bozzano and Manenti, BASF's process was first utilized in [[Leuna]], Germany in 1923. Operating conditions consisted of \"high\" temperatures (between 300 and 400&nbsp;\u00b0C) and pressures (between 250 and 350 atm) with a [[zinc]]/[[chromium oxide]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=July 2022}} catalyst.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nUS patent 1,569,775 ({{patent|US|1569775}}) was applied for on 4 Sep 1924 and issued on 12 January 1926 to BASF; the process used a [[chromium]] and [[manganese oxide]] [[catalyst]] with extremely vigorous conditions: pressures ranging from 50 to 220 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], and temperatures up to 450&nbsp;\u00b0C. Modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts (commonly copper) capable of operating at lower pressures. The modern low pressure methanol (LPM) process was developed by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in the late 1960s {{patent|US|3326956}} with the technology patent since long expired.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], methanol was used as a fuel in several German military rocket designs, under the name M-Stoff, and in a roughly 50/50 mixture with [[hydrazine]], known as [[C-Stoff]].\n\nThe use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the [[1970s energy crisis|oil crises of the 1970s]]. By the mid-1990s, over 20,000 methanol \"[[flexible fuel vehicle]]s\" (FFV) capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the U.S. In addition, low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in Europe during much of the 1980s and early-1990s. Automakers stopped building methanol FFVs by the late-1990s, switching their attention to ethanol-fueled vehicles. While the methanol FFV program was a technical success, rising methanol pricing in the mid- to late-1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished interest in [[methanol fuel]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Halderman, James D. |author2=Martin, Tony |title=Hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LqgeAQAAIAAJ}}|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-504414-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, a process was developed by [[Mobil]] for [[Methanol to gasoline|producing gasoline]] fuel from methanol.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ihsmarkit.com/pdf/RP282_toc_173824110917062932.pdf |title=Methanol to Gasoline: A Private Report by the Process Economics Program |author=Ronald Smith |date=1 December 2011 |access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nBetween the 1960s and 1980s methanol emerged as a precursor to the feedstock chemicals [[acetic acid]] and [[acetic anhydride]].
